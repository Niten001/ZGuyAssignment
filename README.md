# ZGuy Node.js Web App Assignment - Sign in/Sign up form

This repository contains both the development (in /src) and build (in /build) code for the Sign in/Sign up form
I created for my [ZGuy Software Solutions](http://www.zguy.com/) job application. This web app runs both the front end
using a React-based user interface (written in TypeScript) and the back end using Node.js with a PostgreSQL database. The 
application is contained in Docker containers and can be run using Docker Compose.

## Usage

To run this program, ensure you have Docker installed on your system, you can download Docker [here](https://www.docker.com/products/container-runtime)

Then you simply run following commands in the project directory:
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
